# tic-tac-toe
A game of tic-tac-toe which can be played in the terminal.
It was written in C++, compiled with the g++ compuler. 
Written and tested on Linux, so it may not work on Windows systems. 

It displays a board with columns 1-3 and rows A-C, prompting the user
to chose a tile, such as A1 for top left, B1 for middle left, and so on. 

If a move results in a player having three in a row, the game ends and the 
winning sequence is displayed in green instead of the default color. 

Player can play as many games as they would like, restart the current game, 
and quit at any point.

This was a simple project to get into making programs in C++ outside of a classroom setting.
